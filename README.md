# Juxtaposition-Enhancer
Userscript that improves Pretendo's Juxtaposition on the web.

This userscript does things that already exist on other platforms but Juxt has for some reason not added them on the PC/Mobile website and I've got no idea why so I'm doing it myself.

## Installation
You will need a userscript manager, I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net).

[Click me to install](https://github.com/ItsFuntum/Juxtaposition-Enhancer/raw/refs/heads/main/Juxtaposition%20Pretendo%20Enhancer.user.js)

## Features
Currently it allows you to:
* Create posts
* Reply to posts
* Delete posts
* View who yeah'd a post (only works on posts you made)
