# Juxtaposition-Enhancer
Userscript that improves Pretendo's Juxtaposition on the web.

The userscript does things that already exist on other platforms but for some reason *aren't* on the PC/Mobile website, and I've got no idea why so I'm doing it myself.

## Features
Currently it allows you to:
* Create posts (Tip: Click on a community to post!)
* Reply to posts
* View who yeah'd a post (only works on your own posts)

## Installation
You will need a userscript manager, I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net).

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/ItsFuntum/Juxtaposition-Enhancer/raw/refs/heads/main/Juxtaposition%20Pretendo%20Enhancer.user.js) or [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/559732-juxtaposition-pretendo-enhancer)
