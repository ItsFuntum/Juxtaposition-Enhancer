# Juxtaposition-Enhancer
Userscript that improves Pretendo's Juxtaposition on the web.

This userscript does things that already exist on other platforms but Juxt has for some reason not added them on the PC/Mobile website and I've got no idea why so I'm doing it myself.

## Installation
You will need a userscript manager, I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net).
